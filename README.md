# Handwritten-Digits-Recognition
Handwritten Digits Recognition is a machine learning project that focuses on classifying grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9) using the MNIST dataset. The project demonstrates the use of both classical ML models like Logistic Regression and SVM, as well as deep learning techniques using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Keras.
